# Business Process Service
**ServiceID**: business-process-service

Business Process Service in the NIMBLE Microservice Infrastructure based on [Camunda](https://camunda.org/)
  
## Configuration

Base configuration can be found at src/main/resources/application.properties and bootstrap.yml.
[Spring Cloud Config](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/) is used for central configuration management. A central configuration is hosted on [https://github.com/nimble-platform/cloud-config](https://github.com/nimble-platform/cloud-config)
and injected during startup.

## Swagger

The Business Process API is designed using the [swagger.io editor](http://editor.swagger.io) (file: src/main/resources/api.yml) and the code generator for the Spring framework. 
The Maven plugin (swagger-codegen-maven-plugin) is used to generate defined interfaces automatically in each Maven build.
In addition the Business Process Service provides a proxy to the REST API from Camunda.

## How-to

### Service build and startup

 # standalone
 mvn clean spring-boot:run
 
 # in docker environment from core cloud infrastructure using 8085 as internal port
 mvn clean package docker:build -P docker
